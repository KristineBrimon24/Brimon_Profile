                Technology widespread today, and I believe that everyone is involved with it since it is so 
            crucial to our way of life. Communication, cooperation, and innovation all of which rely on 
            technology are driving the development of our shared future. The Internet today serves as a 
            worldwide marketplace, workspace, and meeting place where people from all over the world 
            can engage and share knowledge. The “participation gap” is widening between youth who have 
            access to technology and the Internet and those who are not given the chance to access, 
            create, and participate in the global digital media culture. However, researchers like Henry 
            Jenkins from MIT have discovered that the digital divide in the United States can now be more 
            accurately described as a “participation gap.” <br><br>

                There are various ways to use technology and digital media for global learning, such as 
            helping students develop global media literacy. This will enable them to analyze and assess 
            global media, including translations from other languages and international sources. The way 
            that individuals, communities, and cultures are portrayed in the international mass media is 
            another factor that influences cross-cultural understanding. Learn about the individual 
            perspectives that shape major issues; they share their viewpoints to people in other nations via 
            podcasts, blog posts, and videos. Join global knowledge networks to help students understand 
            other cultures, integrate information, and work together to expand on what they already know. 
            Virtual reality simulates real-world experiences to test global ideas, utilizing the capacity of 
            virtual simulation to comprehend global complexity and provide answers. Students should use 
            technology to share their findings and thoughts with a worldwide audience by publishing 
            online. <br><br>

                By doing so, we can better understand how technology and digital media are used for 
            global learning. We can now engage with one another despite the fact that some of your family 
            may be far away by the help of technology and the internet, which allows you to communicate 
            with them in a variety of methods including video calls, text messages, chats, and more. It's a 
            big assistance for us since we can now share opinions from people all around the world via 
            media and technology, which allows us to gain some information about the many global issues. 
            As the epidemic spreads, these media and technological advancements are becoming more and 
            more common for global education.
