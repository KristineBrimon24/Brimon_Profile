                        TOPIC: The Implications of Human Identity Chips: HUMAN MICROCHIPPING PROS AND CONS
        When utilized to store credit cards, membership cards, and even health records, identity chips can perform 
        similarly to a smartphone wallet. Many scientists and consumers are worried about the ethical ramifications 
        of this technology being incorporated into the human body, though. Today, I believe that many individuals in 
        numerous nations are experimenting known as “human microchipping.” Several technologies exist that can make our 
        lives easier, but the human microchipping has raised many questions about how this happened. It’s so incredible 
        since we didn’t think it would work that many researchers tried it and used injection to insert the chips into 
        their bodies. Yet since many researchers and experimenters are already doing this flawlessly without endangering 
        anyone, they didn’t want to persuade us to conduct these kinds of studies, which is why they aren’t more widely 
        used today. Although it is so fantastic and many people are helped by it, but there is a risk to our bodies when
        we do this. <br><br>

        Your ID, credit card information, bus pass, library card, and many other sources of information that you 
        currently carry in your purse or wallet can instead be stored on an RFID chip that is embedded under your
        skin using a procedure that is already affordable and accessible. This provides a digital interface to the 
        real world that is focused on the holder’s identity. <br><br>

        There are a lot of advantages that will enable us to improve the quality of our daily lives, despite the fact
        that we can question what exactly human microchipping is and how it might assist us. Since technology is so 
        widely used today, RFID helps us, for instance, in airports, train stations, bus stops, and restaurants so 
        that we can pay without having to swipe a credit card; instead, we simply scan our hands with chips. This 
        allows us to avoid having to take our credit cards out of our wallets. In an emergency, it can also assist 
        parents in finding their kids. Also, offenders who stage combat scenes while incarcerated can be identified
        without lying by using the chips to track down who is responsible. They can secure their valuable possessions, 
        including ATM cards, using RFID technology. Since they own the RFID device and it is applied to their bodies, 
        thieves cannot take their valuable possessions. By performing this human microchipping, this RFID is a huge
        benefit. <br><br>
        
        Nevertheless, these advantages come at a risk to everyone and ourselves. We’re not sure if we’ll be alright 
        after they lay the chips down. What outcomes are there? Can we carry on as usual? Adverse tissue reactions, 
        electrical concerns, and maybe most crucially “incompatibility” with powerful-magnet medical equipment like 
        magnetic resonance imaging are just a few of
        the problems associated with human microchipping, according to the FDA (MRIs). Of course, there is a lot of 
        risk because it includes medications, injections, and other things that could make our bodies weak. And if 
        there’s companies you let to scan your chip for identification they may monitor you wherever you go and also 
        it might do harm to you. Even if you put a piece of technology in your body, bugs will still exist since it has 
        something to do with technology.
