                Asexual reproduction is used to produce a human individual or human embryo that is genetically 
                identical to the original. This can be accomplished via a variety of methods, such as Somatic 
                cell nuclear transfer and cell reprogramming (SCNT). Even though human cloning is not widely 
                practiced today, numerous scientists have experimented on both humans and animals in several 
                nations. With the aid of various approaches, such as cell programming, they can convert a 
                differentiated cell, such as a skin cell, back into a pluripotent stem cell. These cells can 
                assist in using it to produce an embryo with donor genetic material. Because it relies on technology 
                to accomplish its goals, it is rather challenging to understand. A human egg cell’s nucleus is removed 
                and replaced with the nucleus of a sematic cell or non-reproductive cell from the donor during the SCNT, 
                also known as a somatic cell nuclear transfer. A donor-matched embryo is created when an egg cell is 
                stimulated to divide and grow into an embryo. <br><br>

                Due to ethical concerns about technological abuse, the potential for physical and psychological harm to 
                both the cloned and the body of the living, as well as the potential impact on human identity and dignity, 
                human cloning has become a contentious topic for everyone. Due to these limitations for human cloning, numerous 
                nations have enacted legislation and regulations. Due to the moral dilemmas involved, which greatly increase the risk 
                to humans and may even result in death, several nations choose not to implement it. That’s the reason why human cloning 
                wasn’t effective enough to be introduced to our country; perhaps some other nations tried it, but their attempts failed. 
                Similar to what I’ve said, it raises ethical concerns in a lot of different nations, such as the violation of human dignity.
                 Yes, through cloning, we might be able to see and obtain a person’s dignity as a human in order to use their body for tests 
                 and organ transplants or to value their lives. Possible exploitation could result in the commodification of their human existence 
                 through the creation or production of organs for transplantation, for example. <br><br>

                Safety concerns exist, including some for the surrogate mother as well as the cloned person. The possibility of the cloned person 
                developing some abnormality exists. Cloned people may experience psychological and social effects as a result of their distinct genetic 
                identity, such as feeling as though they are always in their donor’s shadow. If some individuals are aware that the person is alive thanks 
                to cloning, this could lead to discrimination. Last but not least,
                there are religious and moral concerns. While some religions support this, many others do not,
                arguing that human life should not be treated with any less respect. To create another life
                through cloning, human cloning is not a good idea. Yes, it is very helpful to others like the
                parents of children who have died and are unable to have children again so they can suggest
                and tell researchers to clone their child, get some organs or genetics to make the cloning
                successful. Perhaps it is good for some researchers to get their famous, pay them higher just to
                clone humans. However, many of these attempts, particularly those involving animal cloning,
                have failed. If any have, it was only a matter of time before they perished. That is why creating
                another life through human cloning is not beneficial to everyone. May we be thankful for the
                life that the Lord gave us.
